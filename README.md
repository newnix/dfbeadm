# DFBEADM(1) A Boot Environment Manager for HAMMER2
This is a tool inspired by the `beadm` utility for FreeBSD/Illumos systems that creates and manages
ZFS boot environments. This utility in contrast is written from the ground up in C, this should
provide better performance, integration, and extensibility than the POSIX `sh` and `awk` script
it was inspired by. During the time this project has been worked on, `beadm` has been superceeded by
`bectl` on FreeBSD. After hammering out some of the outstanding internal logic issues, I might look at
providing a similar interface to the command as `bectl`.
